## 📋 About
This project demonstrates fundamental computer science concepts including data structures, algorithms, and database operations. Built as part of my CS portfolio to showcase practical application of programming principles.

## ✨ Features
- ➕ **Add Students** - Create new student records with validation
- ✏️ **Edit Records** - Update existing student information
- 🗑️ **Delete Students** - Remove records with confirmation
- 🔍 **Search Functionality** - Filter by name, ID, course, or email
- 📊 **Statistics Dashboard** - View total students, average grades, and course count
- 🎨 **Color-Coded Grades** - Visual indicators for performance levels (Green ≥80%, Blue ≥60%, Red <60%)
- 💾 **Data Persistence** - Records saved locally using localStorage
- 📱 **Responsive Design** - Works on all devices

## 🛠️ Built With
- HTML5
- CSS3 (Tailwind CSS)
- Vanilla JavaScript
- LocalStorage API

## 💡 CS Concepts Demonstrated
- **CRUD Operations** - Create, Read, Update, Delete functionality
- **Data Structures** - Arrays and objects for data management
- **Search Algorithms** - Filtering and searching through records
- **Form Validation** - Input verification and error handling
- **Array Methods** - map(), filter(), find(), reduce()
- **Event Handling** - User interaction management
- **DOM Manipulation** - Dynamic UI updates
- **Data Persistence** - LocalStorage for saving data

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Clone this repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SyedMehrooz01/student-management-system0.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Start managing student records!

## 📸 Usage Guide

### Adding Students
1. Fill in all fields: Student ID, Name, Email, Course, Grade (0-100), Year
2. Click "Add Student" button
3. Student appears in the table below

### Editing Students
1. Click the "✏️ Edit" button next to any student
2. Form fills with student data
3. Modify fields as needed
4. Click "Update Student"

### Deleting Students
1. Click the "🗑️ Delete" button
2. Confirm deletion in popup
3. Student removed from records

### Searching
Type in the search box to filter by name, ID, course, or email in real-time.

## 🎯 Validation Rules
- All fields are required
- Student ID must be unique (no duplicates)
- Grade must be between 0-100
- Email must be in valid format

## 💻 Technical Implementation
- Pure JavaScript (no frameworks)
- No backend required - runs entirely in browser
- Data stored in localStorage (persists across sessions)
- Responsive grid layout with Tailwind CSS
- Clean, maintainable code structure
- Real-time statistics calculation

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- [ ] Export data to CSV/Excel
- [ ] Import student data from files
- [ ] Attendance tracking system
- [ ] Grade analytics and charts
- [ ] Print student reports
- [ ] Sort table by different columns
- [ ] Bulk operations (delete multiple, import CSV)
- [ ] Student profile pictures
- [ ] Advanced filters (by grade range, year, etc.)
